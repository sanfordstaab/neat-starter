S﻿o when I get this site going I want to somehow get a heiarchical category tree created and have user privileges per category with those privileges going down to any sub-categories as well unless there is an exception privilege setting at the sub-category.

T﻿he home page should list all the categories a user has access to or cares about with color settings if the user is a category owner, editor, or user vetting agent.

T﻿he site should be private with anyone allowed to form a join request form which would contain:

1. M﻿ember name, first and last
2. M﻿ember phone number
3. M﻿ember eMail address
4. M﻿embers reason to join
5. N﻿ames of any existing members of the community the requestor knows as references.
